# If you are applying for a Twitter/X developer account to participate as a miner, you can use the following description in your application:
#
# I am participating in a game where users make predictions about livestream events by replying to official block announcement tweets.
#
# My application will:
# - Read block announcement tweets from the game organizerâ€™s account.
# - Reply to those tweets with a prediction
# - (Optionally) read replies to see my own submissions.
#
# I will use the Twitter API to:
# - Read tweets from a specific account (the organizer).
# - Post replies to those tweets with my prediction
#
# This is an educational and experimental project. I will only interact with public tweets and replies, and will not collect or analyze data beyond my own participation.

# --- Twitter API Configuration ---
#
# To ensure your app can post tweets and replies, follow these steps:
# 1. Go to https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps and select your app.
# 2. Under 'User authentication settings' or 'App permissions', select:
#      - Read and write (Read and Post Posts and profile information)
#      - Do NOT select 'Read' only (cannot post), and only select 'Direct message' if you need DM access.
# 3. For 'Type of App', choose:
#      - Web App, Automated App or Bot (Confidential client)
# 4. Save your changes.
# 5. After changing permissions, REGENERATE your Access Token and Access Token Secret in the 'Keys and tokens' section.
# 6. Update the values below with your new access token and secret.
#
# If you see a 403 error about OAuth permissions, your app likely does not have 'Read and write' enabled, or you need to regenerate your tokens after changing permissions.
