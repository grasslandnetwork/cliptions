# Examples for Cliptions Browser Modules

This directory contains example and demo scripts for the modular Twitter automation system used in the Cliptions prediction network.

## Purpose
- Demonstrate how to use the core modules and interfaces in `browser/`
- Provide quick, runnable examples for development and testing
- Serve as living documentation for module usage and expected output

## Usage
Each script in this directory is self-contained and can be run directly from the project root. For example:

```bash
python browser/examples/demo_block_announcement.py
```

These scripts do **not** require Twitter credentials or actual browser automationâ€”they focus on content formatting, data model usage, and interface demonstration.

## Scripts
- `demo_block_announcement.py`: Shows how to create and format block announcement tweets using the `BlockAnnouncementTask`.

Feel free to add more examples as new modules are developed!
