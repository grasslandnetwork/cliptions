# MVP Production Launch Tasks (Vertical Slice Plan)

## Overview
This task list outlines the refactoring and implementation plan for the Cliptions MVP, following a Vertical Slice architecture. Each task represents a self-contained, testable feature that must pass CI before moving to the next.

**Important Notes:**
- **Rust 2021**: No `mod.rs` files needed - modules are automatically discovered from directory structure
- **Code Reuse**: Always check `binaries_architecture.md` for existing function signatures before implementing new code
- **Vertical Slices**: Each subcommand should be a complete, testable feature slice
