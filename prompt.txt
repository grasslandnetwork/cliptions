We're going to make a game where players try to guess the output of a random number generator. The agent thats closest to the number gets the prize.

We make it so that participants pay fee to make a guess. And all participants will get a portion of the payout based on how close they are to the number


Mechanics of the Game

    Participation Fee:
        Each participant pays a fixed fee (e.g., $10) to submit a guess.
        A percentage of each fee (e.g., 80%) goes into the prize pool, and the remaining (e.g., 20%) is retained by the platform for operational costs.

    Scoring System:
        Define a scoring metric based on proximity to the target number.
        Example: Score=11+∣Guess−Target∣Score=1+∣Guess−Target∣1​, where smaller differences result in higher scores.

    Payout Distribution:
        Total prize pool is divided proportionally based on participants’ scores.
        A participant’s payout is calculated as:
        Payouti=Prize Pool×Scorei∑Scores
        Payouti​=Prize Pool×∑ScoresScorei​​

    Example:
        100 participants, each paying $10 → $800 prize pool.
        Target number = 50.
        Participants' guesses and scores are calculated.
        Prize pool is divided proportionally based on scores.

Detailed Example

    Setup:
        Target number: 50.
        5 participants make the following guesses: 48, 52, 45, 60, 70.
    Scoring:
        Scores are computed as:
            Score1=11+∣48−50∣=0.33Score1​=1+∣48−50∣1​=0.33
            Score2=11+∣52−50∣=0.33Score2​=1+∣52−50∣1​=0.33
            Score3=11+∣45−50∣=0.17Score3​=1+∣45−50∣1​=0.17
            Score4=11+∣60−50∣=0.09Score4​=1+∣60−50∣1​=0.09
            Score5=11+∣70−50∣=0.05Score5​=1+∣70−50∣1​=0.05
        Total score sum = 0.33+0.33+0.17+0.09+0.05=0.970.33+0.33+0.17+0.09+0.05=0.97.
    Payout:
        Calculate each participant’s payout:
            Payout1=0.330.97×800=272.16Payout1​=0.970.33​×800=272.16
            Payout2=0.330.97×800=272.16Payout2​=0.970.33​×800=272.16
            Payout3=0.170.97×800=140.49Payout3​=0.970.17​×800=140.49
            Payout4=0.090.97×800=74.23Payout4​=0.970.09​×800=74.23
            Payout5=0.050.97×800=41.24Payout5​=0.970.05​×800=41.24.

Advantages

    Incentivizes Participation: Even if participants don’t guess the exact number, they can still win part of the pool, encouraging more guesses.
    Scalable: Works well with large numbers of participants, as rewards scale proportionally.
    Fairness: Closer guesses receive a larger portion of the prize, rewarding better performance.
    Engagement: Adds a layer of excitement as everyone feels they have a chance to win something.
