Integration Tests for Cliptions Browser Automation

This directory contains integration tests that use real browser automation
to test the complete workflows end-to-end. These tests:

- Use actual browser instances
- Make real network requests to Twitter/X
- Test the full user journey
- May require authentication/cookies
- Are slower than unit tests but provide confidence in real-world scenarios

Run with: pytest browser/integration_tests/ -v
