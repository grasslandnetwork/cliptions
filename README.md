# Cliptions

Welcome to Cliptions

What exactly is a "Cliption"?

A Cliption is a prediction contract that pays out based on how closely a player's submitted caption matches the CLIP model's interpretation of a randomly chosen, upcoming timestamp in a livestream. It's not a tradable asset, just a commitment to your best guess in an open contest.

Cliptions are like options contracts but instead of betting on a price or event, you're betting on AI's semantic interpretation of a future moment.

In other words:

**Cliptions = Semantic options contracts**

**CLIP similarity score = Strike price**

**Frame reveal timestamp = Expiry date**

**Prize pool = Liquidity pool**

## What is CLIP?

CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) is a neural network created by OpenAI and trained to connect visual concepts (images, videos) with textual descriptions (English words or phrases). https://github.com/openai/CLIP

It can look at an image or video frame and accurately predict which textual description best matches it‚Äîor vice versa.

In Cliptions, this capability is specifically used for scoring predictions:

- Players submit text predictions for upcoming video frames.
- CLIP determines how closely each submitted caption matches the actual video frame's content, semantically.
- Predictions ranked closest by CLIP's embeddings win payouts.

This is how Cliptions leverages CLIP's unique strength in semantic interpretation‚Äîcreating a novel betting product around predicting the AI's understanding of visual moments.

### Gameplay
1. The Agent announces a new block on Twitter with a target frame
2. Players submit predictions in two steps:
   - First, reply to announcement with a commitment hash of their prediction
   - Later, reveal their actual prediction and salt to verify the commitment
3. When that moment arrives and the frame is revealed, each prediction is compared using CLIP ([OpenAI's vision-language AI model](https://github.com/openai/CLIP))
4. Players are ranked by how well their predictions matched CLIP's understanding
5. The prize pool is distributed based on rankings, with better predictions earning larger shares

### Key Rules
- **Submission Deadline:** All predictions must be submitted **before** the target timestamp. Late submissions are disqualified.
- **Commitment Format:** Predictions must be submitted as **hash commitments** along with the player's wallet address.
- **Reveal Phase:** After the target frame is posted, players must publicly reveal their plaintext guess and salt.
- **No Edited Tweets:** Edited commitment tweets are **disqualified** and **no refunds** are issued for fees paid.

### Key Features
- **Timestamp Predictions:** Guess how an AI Agent will interpret a specific future video frame.
- **AI-Powered:** Uses OpenAI's CLIP model for objective scoring.
- **Web3 Integration:** Decentralized gameplay and prize distribution.
- **Crypto Rewards:** Prize pools paid out based on prediction accuracy.
- **Transparent:** All calculations and rankings are verifiable.

### Example Block
1. Agent tweets "@block2 #targetframe20250223_133057EST from live stream of a cat sanctuary"
2. Players participate via Twitter:
   - Submit commitment hash as reply to announcement
   - After frame reveal, reply with prediction and salt
   - Example prediction: "Cat shelter with caretakers"
3. After target frame is revealed and players share their predictions, CLIP calculates similarity scores
4. Players are ranked by score
5. Prize pool is distributed according to rankings

## Score and Payout Calculation
The system calculates payouts based on similarity rankings between guesses and the target image.

### Ranking Process
1. Calculate CLIP embeddings for the target image and each guess.
2. Calculate cosine similarity between the target and each guess.
3. Rank guesses by similarity (highest to lowest).

### Payout Distribution
The payout system uses a position-based scoring method that:
- Distributes the entire prize pool.
- Rewards higher ranks with larger shares.
- Handles ties fairly.

#### Basic Scoring (No Ties)
For n players, each position's score is calculated as:
```
position_score = (n - position) / sum(1..n)
```

Example for 3 players:
- Denominator = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
- 1st place: 3/6 = 0.50 (50% of pool)
- 2nd place: 2/6 ‚âà 0.33 (33% of pool)
- 3rd place: 1/6 ‚âà 0.17 (17% of pool)

#### Handling Ties
When multiple guesses have equal similarity scores:
1. Group tied positions together.
2. Calculate combined points for tied positions.
3. Split points equally among tied guesses.

Example with 5 players and ties:
```
Similarities:
Player1: 0.9 (tied for 1st/2nd)
Player2: 0.9 (tied for 1st/2nd)
Player3: 0.7
Player4: 0.5 (tied for 4th/5th)
Player5: 0.5 (tied for 4th/5th)

Groups:
[Player1, Player2]   - Split points for 1st/2nd
[Player3]           - Gets points for 3rd
[Player4, Player5]   - Split points for 4th/5th
```
