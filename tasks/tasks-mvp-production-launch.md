# MVP Production Launch Tasks (Vertical Slice Plan)

## Overview
This task list outlines the refactoring and implementation plan for the Cliptions MVP, following a Vertical Slice architecture. Each task represents a self-contained, testable feature that must pass CI before moving to the next.

**Important Notes:**
- **Rust 2021**: No `mod.rs` files needed - modules are automatically discovered from directory structure
- **Code Reuse**: Always check `binaries_architecture.md` for existing function signatures before implementing new code
- **Vertical Slices**: Each subcommand should be a complete, testable feature slice

- [ ] Monitor block progress (commitments, fees, reveals, verification, payouts)
- [ ] Complete a block and verify all data is correct
- [ ] Monitor, debug, and document any issues found during live testing
- [ ] Document the full block lifecycle with real data
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect real-world usage and troubleshooting

### Slice 9: Centralized File Path Management (v0.7.2)
**Status**: [ ] Not Started
**Priority**: Critical
**Description**: Refactor the application to use a centralized path management system for all configuration and data files, storing them in `~/.cliptions`. This will ensure the application can be run from any directory.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] **Add `dirs` Crate**: 
    - [ ] Run `cargo add dirs` to add the dependency to `Cargo.toml`. This crate provides cross-platform access to user directories (like the home directory).
- [ ] **Create `PathManager` in `src/config.rs`**:
    - [ ] Define a new public struct called `PathManager`.
    - [ ] Implement a `new()` function for `PathManager`.
    - [ ] In `new()`, get the user's home directory using `dirs::home_dir()`.
    - [ ] Construct the base path `~/.cliptions`.
    - [ ] Create the `~/.cliptions` directory and its subdirectories (`data`, `miner`, `validator`) if they don't exist. Use `std::fs::create_dir_all()`.
- [ ] **Implement Path Getter Functions**:
    - [ ] Add public methods to `PathManager` to return `PathBuf` for each required file:
        - `get_config_path()` -> `~/.cliptions/config.yaml`
        - `get_blocks_path()` -> `~/.cliptions/data/blocks.json`
        - `get_twitter_posts_path()` -> `~/.cliptions/data/twitter_posts.json`
        - `get_scoring_versions_path()` -> `~/.cliptions/data/scoring_versions.json`
        - `get_validator_tweet_cache_path()` -> `~/.cliptions/validator/validator_tweet_cache.json`
        - `get_miner_commitments_path()` -> `~/.cliptions/miner/commitments.json`
        - `get_validator_collected_commitments_path()` -> `~/.cliptions/validator/collected_commitments.json`
        - `get_validator_collected_reveals_path()` -> `~/.cliptions/validator/collected_reveals.json`
- [ ] **Integrate `PathManager` with `ConfigManager`**:
    - [ ] Modify `ConfigManager::new()` and `ConfigManager::with_path()` to use `PathManager` to determine the config file path. The default `new()` should use `PathManager::new().get_config_path()`.
- [ ] **Refactor Codebase to Use `PathManager`**:
    - [ ] Search the codebase for hardcoded paths (e.g., `"data/blocks.json"`, `"config/config.yaml"`).
    - [ ] Replace all hardcoded paths with calls to the appropriate getter functions in `PathManager`.
- [ ] **Handle Missing `config.yaml`**:
    - [ ] Ensure the application provides a clear error message if `~/.cliptions/config.yaml` is not found, instructing the user to copy the template.
- [ ] **Update Documentation**:
    - [ ] Modify `README.md` and any other relevant documentation to reflect the new file locations under `~/.cliptions`.
- [ ] **Testing**:
    - [ ] Write unit tests for `PathManager` to ensure paths are generated correctly and directories are created.
- [ ] Update `Cargo.toml` to version `0.7.2`.
- [ ] Commit the changes and create a git tag `v0.7.2`.
- [ ] **Verify the new tag triggers and passes all checks in GitHub Actions.**
- [ ] Update this task list to mark all tasks as completed.

### Slice 10: Fix Block Version JSON Type Inconsistency (v0.7.3)
**Status**: [ ] Not Started
**Priority**: Critical
**Description**: Fix the JSON parsing error in calculate-scores caused by inconsistent block_version field types.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- The `BlockData` struct in `src/types.rs` defines `block_version: i32` (integer)
- The `save_to_blocks_json` function in `src/actions/verify_commitments.rs` writes `"block_version": "1"` (string)
- This creates inconsistency in `data/blocks.json` where some blocks have string values and others have integer values
- The `calculate-scores` command fails with: `Error: Json(Error("invalid type: string \"1\", expected i32", line: 4, column: 24))`

**Tasks**:
- [ ] **Fix the JSON generation code**:
    - [ ] In `src/actions/verify_commitments.rs`, line 356, change `"block_version": "1"` to `"block_version": 1`
    - [ ] Verify this matches the `BlockData` struct definition in `src/types.rs`
- [ ] **Fix existing JSON data**:
    - [ ] Update `data/blocks.json` to ensure all `block_version` fields are integers, not strings
    - [ ] Test that the file can be parsed without errors
- [ ] **Add validation**:
    - [ ] Add a test to ensure `block_version` is always written as an integer
    - [ ] Consider adding a validation function to check JSON consistency
- [ ] **Test the fix**:
    - [ ] Run `./target/release/cliptions calculate-scores -b 3 -p 0.015` to verify it works
    - [ ] Test with other block numbers to ensure consistency
- [ ] **Update documentation**:
    - [ ] Add a note about the block_version field type requirement
    - [ ] Update any relevant documentation about JSON schema
- [ ] Update `Cargo.toml` to version `0.7.3`.
- [ ] Commit the changes and create a git tag `v0.7.3`.
- [ ] **Verify the new tag triggers and passes all checks in GitHub Actions.**
- [ ] Update this task list to mark all tasks as completed.

### Finalization (v0.7.3)
**Status**: [ ] Not Started
**Priority**: Medium
**Description**: Finalize the project for release.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Test the full, end-to-end user workflow using the single `cliptions` CLI tool.
- [ ] Update `README.md` with detailed, platform-specific (Windows, macOS, Linux) instructions for compiling the application and using each subcommand.
- [ ] **Post-MVP Refactoring**: Review the completed `actions` and identify shared logic. Consolidate business models/rules into a `src/domain/` directory and shared technical services (like the Twitter client) into a `src/infra/` directory to improve long-term maintainability.
- [ ] Update this task list to mark all tasks as completed.
