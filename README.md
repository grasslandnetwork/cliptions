### Gameplay
1. The Agent announces a new round on Twitter with a target frame
2. Players submit predictions in two steps:
   - First, reply to announcement with a commitment hash of their prediction
   - Later, reveal their actual prediction and salt to verify the commitment
3. When that moment arrives and the frame is revealed, each prediction is compared using CLIP ([OpenAI's vision-language AI model](https://github.com/openai/CLIP))
4. Players are ranked by how well their predictions matched CLIP's understanding
5. The prize pool is distributed based on rankings, with better predictions earning larger shares

### Key Rules
- **Submission Deadline:** All predictions must be submitted **before** the target timestamp. Late submissions are disqualified.
- **Commitment Format:** Predictions must be submitted as **hash commitments** along with the player's wallet address.
- **Reveal Phase:** After the target frame is posted, players must publicly reveal their plaintext guess and salt.
- **No Edited Tweets:** Edited commitment tweets are **disqualified** and **no refunds** are issued for fees paid.

### Key Features
- **Timestamp Predictions:** Guess how an AI Agent will interpret a specific future video frame.
- **AI-Powered:** Uses OpenAI's CLIP model for objective scoring.
- **Web3 Integration:** Decentralized gameplay and prize distribution.
- **Crypto Rewards:** Prize pools paid out based on prediction accuracy.
- **Transparent:** All calculations and rankings are verifiable.

### Example Round
1. Agent tweets "@round2 #targetframe20250223_133057EST from live stream of a cat sanctuary"
2. Players participate via Twitter:
   - Submit commitment hash as reply to announcement
   - After frame reveal, reply with prediction and salt
   - Example prediction: "Cat shelter with caretakers"
3. After target frame is revealed and players share their predictions, CLIP calculates similarity scores
4. Players are ranked by score
5. Prize pool is distributed according to rankings

## CLI Tools

RealMir provides a complete suite of Rust-based CLI tools for all game operations. All tools use real CLIP models by default for accurate similarity calculations.

### Commitment Generation

Generate secure commitment hashes for your predictions:

```bash
# Basic commitment generation
./target/release/generate_commitment "Cat sanctuary with woman wearing snoopy sweater" --salt "random_secret_123"

# Verbose output with details
./target/release/generate_commitment "My prediction" --salt "mysalt" --verbose
```

**Example Output:**
```
Commitment: b30bc27636a63a2c9ce07b9b24e39161e64e975399df2c773c4240b924735ed4
```

### Score Calculation

Calculate similarity scores and rankings for a round:

```bash
# Basic score calculation with CLIP
./target/release/calculate_scores target.jpg 100.0 "ocean waves" "mountain sunset" "city skyline"

# Save results to JSON file
./target/release/calculate_scores --output json --output-file results.json target.jpg 100.0 "guess1" "guess2"

# Detailed similarity breakdown
./target/release/calculate_scores --detailed --verbose target.jpg 100.0 "prediction1" "prediction2"
```

### Payout Processing

Process payouts for completed rounds:

```bash
# Process single round
./target/release/process_payouts round1 --prize-pool 100.0

# Process all rounds with batch mode
./target/release/process_payouts --all

# Save payout results with error handling
./target/release/process_payouts --all --continue-on-error --output csv --output-file payouts.csv
```

### Commitment Verification

Verify the integrity of player commitments:

```bash
# Verify single round
./target/release/verify_commitments round1

# Batch verify all rounds
./target/release/verify_commitments --all --verbose

# Strict mode - fail on any invalid commitment
./target/release/verify_commitments --all --strict --output json --output-file verification.json
```

### Advanced Usage

All CLI tools support advanced features for production use:

```bash
# Use custom CLIP model
./target/release/calculate_scores --clip-model models/custom-clip target.jpg 100.0 "guess1"

# Load configuration from YAML
./target/release/process_payouts --config config.yaml --all

# Testing mode with MockEmbedder
./target/release/calculate_scores --use-mock target.jpg 100.0 "test1" "test2"

# Multiple output formats
./target/release/verify_commitments round1 --output table  # Default
./target/release/verify_commitments round1 --output json
./target/release/verify_commitments round1 --output csv

# Quiet mode for scripts
./target/release/generate_commitment "My prediction" --salt "mysalt" --quiet
```

**Common Options:**
- `--verbose` - Detailed progress information
- `--no-color` - Disable colored output for scripts
- `--output-file <path>` - Save results to file
- `--config <path>` - Load YAML configuration
- `--continue-on-error` - Continue batch processing on errors

## Score and Payout Calculation
The system calculates payouts based on similarity rankings between guesses and the target image.

### Ranking Process
1. Calculate CLIP embeddings for the target image and each guess.
2. Calculate cosine similarity between the target and each guess.
3. Rank guesses by similarity (highest to lowest).

### Payout Distribution
The payout system uses a position-based scoring method that:
- Distributes the entire prize pool.
- Rewards higher ranks with larger shares.
- Handles ties fairly.

#### Basic Scoring (No Ties)
For n players, each position's score is calculated as:
```
position_score = (n - position) / sum(1..n)
```

Example for 3 players:
- Denominator = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
- 1st place: 3/6 = 0.50 (50% of pool)
- 2nd place: 2/6 ≈ 0.33 (33% of pool)
- 3rd place: 1/6 ≈ 0.17 (17% of pool)

#### Handling Ties
When multiple guesses have equal similarity scores:
1. Group tied positions together.
2. Calculate combined points for tied positions.
3. Split points equally among tied guesses.

Example with 5 players and ties:
```
Similarities:
Player1: 0.9 (tied for 1st/2nd)
Player2: 0.9 (tied for 1st/2nd)
Player3: 0.7
Player4: 0.5 (tied for 4th/5th)
Player5: 0.5 (tied for 4th/5th)

Groups:
[Player1, Player2]   - Split points for 1st/2nd
[Player3]           - Gets points for 3rd
[Player4, Player5]   - Split points for 4th/5th
```
